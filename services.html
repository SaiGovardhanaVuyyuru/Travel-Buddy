                    Photography is the art, application, and practice of creating durable images by 
                    recording light, either electronically by means of an image sensor, or chemically 
                    by means of a light-sensitive material such as photographic film. 
                    It is employed in many fields of science, manufacturing (e.g., photolithography),
                     and business, as well as its more direct uses for art, film and video production,
                      recreational purposes, hobby, and mass communication.

                    Videography is the process of capturing moving images on electronic media 
                    (e.g., videotape, direct to disk recording, or solid state storage)
                     and even streaming media. The term includes methods of video production 
                     and post-production. It used to be considered the video equivalent of 
                     cinematography (moving images recorded on film stock), but the advent of 
                     digital video recording in the late 20th century blurred the distinction 
                     between the two, as in both methods the intermediary mechanism became the same. 
                     Nowadays, any video work could be called videography, whereas commercial motion 
                     picture production would be called cinematography.
